The files in this directory are the only files which need to be moved
to other parts of the filesystem. Generally, for your convenience, all
the working files are stored within the DET-Python-Anki-Overdrive directory.

Please move these files to the following locations:

bash.bashrc   -->   move to /etc
sudoers       -->   move to /etc
